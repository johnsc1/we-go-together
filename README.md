## Abstract

Github is an essential platform for Free Open Source Software, as it allows communities
to collaborate on software projects. Because it is possible to apply humanities concepts
to databases for a greater understanding of them, it is valid to approach Github this
way. Interest sparked by Ochigame's work to understand the librarian in library circu-
lation is applied here by taking a set of concepts which includes fundamental library
science concepts, research on coding as a literacy, and qualities of peer-to-peer net-
works to understand how Github qualifies as a library entity, how the circulation of
information on Github is peer-to-peer and has library qualities, and the development of
new interdisciplinary terminology to support these connections. This methodology is
established as a valid approach to Github repositories through an in-depth case study
on the pandas repository, using the interdisciplinary terms in the discussion to validate 
their practical use, including the Github Circulation Network and the Community
Code Archivist Librarian. Implications for Library and Information Science and Computer Science as
disciplines are discussed along with interviews from scholars in Library and Information
Science. Overall, this research implies that the case study methodology is a valid ap-
proach to understanding Github repositories, Github should be included as a database
in the library catalog, libraries should further support literacy of code and archiving
code, and the use of DOIs on Github and in the library should be more concretely
established.
