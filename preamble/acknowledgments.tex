I would like to acknowledge Prof. Luman for introducing me to research in the digital humanities and to Ochigame's work in library circulation, which sparked my interest in Library Science. 

I would also like to acknowledge El√¶ Moss, Tim Ribaric, Cody Hennesy, and Patrick Williams for participating in the interviews included in the fourth chapter of the thesis.
